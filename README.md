## Inspiration

To make it easy for folks who do not know ASL(American Sign Language) to communicate with deaf folks

## What it does

The application listens to an user and displays the ASL signs for the words spoken by the user. The user can then do the signs to communicate with a deaf person.

## How we built it

The application was built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Webkit API and Firebase for hosting

## Challenges we ran into

The challenge was to learn ASL first and the gather all the signs for the language and format it in the necessary format.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

A working application that can quickly convert any speech to ASL making it easy to learn ASL and communiate with deaf folks.

## What we learned

Using the webkit API and deploying to Firebase.

## What's next for Sign To Speech

Improve the UI and add more features to make it easy to learn ASL
